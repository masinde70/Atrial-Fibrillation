## **Atrial Fibrillation**
Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a condition where the heartbeat becomes erratic and the upper chambers of 
the heart quiver and shake. If there’s a lurking blood clot, this shaking can break it loose and send it up
through the blood vessels to the brain, where it can cause a stroke. People with AFib have a 5 times greater
likelihood of having a stroke, and doctors typically put patients with the condition on blood-thinning medications 
that prevent clots[article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/heart-monitor-for-your-phone-beats-doctors-at-diagnosing-atrial-fibrillation)
 

- Arrhythmia: An irregular heart rhythm.
- Sinus Rhythm: The normal, regular heart rhythm, paced by the sinus node.
- Atrial fibrillation: An irregular rhythm caused by multiple, haphazard depolarizations across the atria.

### Heart Physiology
The heart is made up of four chambers, two atria and two ventricles. The atria pump blood into the 
ventricles and then the ventricles pump blood throughout the body. Each heart cell is polarized, meaning there is a different electrical charge inside and outside of the cell. At rest, the inside of the cell is negatively charged compared to the outside. When the cell depolarizes,
positive charges outside of the cell flow inside and makes the interior of the cell positively charged relative to the outside. This depolarization causes the cell to contract. The movement of charges across a heart cell’s membrane is the source of the electrical activity that gets measured by an ECG.
