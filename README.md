### Heart Physiology
The heart is made up of four chambers, two atria and two ventricles. The atria pump blood into the 
ventricles and then the ventricles pump blood throughout the body. Each heart cell is polarized, meaning there is a different electrical charge inside and outside of the cell. At rest, the inside of the cell is negatively charged compared to the outside. When the cell depolarizes,
positive charges outside of the cell flow inside and makes the interior of the cell positively charged relative to the outside. This depolarization causes the cell to contract. The movement of charges across a heart cellâ€™s membrane is the source of the electrical activity that gets measured by an ECG.
